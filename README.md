# x32-ESP
A simple wireless knob and mute adjustment for a Behringer X32 soundboard using an ESP8266 and rotary encoder. The original purpose is to adjust `/mtx/06/mix/fader` and toggle `/mtx/06/mix/on` but it would be simple to readjust it for a different channel.

This is still really janky and undocumented, but still good enough for public use

Issues: no way to pull data from the X32 itself... Currently trying to figure it 

I know the source code isn't updloaded yet but I hope to maybe do something soon.
